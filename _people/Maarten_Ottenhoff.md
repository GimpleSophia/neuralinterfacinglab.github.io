#### Biography
Human movement has always been a common theme throughout Maarten's life. Starting with finding the limits of his own movement with track & field on national level, to gaining deeper knowledge on how we move during his Bachelors in Human Movement sciences at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. During this time, a great interest in the technical aspect during data analyses developed, resulting in a switch to a Master Artificial Intelligence. Now, Maarten has found the perfect intersection between how we move and how to detect it by becoming an expert in the field of brain-computer interfaces.
