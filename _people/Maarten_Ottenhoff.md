#### Biography
His interest in human movement started by challenging himself in Athletics, eventually racing a national level. Gradually, the need for a deeper understanding led him to obstain his BSc in human movement sciences at the Vrije Universteit in Amsterdam. During his bachelor thesis, he noticed that he enjoyed the technical work of the data analysis more, thus pivotting to a MSc in Artificial Intelligence. Eventually, he found the challenging field of brain-computer interfaces at the intersection of his interests, leading him to his current PhD project.
