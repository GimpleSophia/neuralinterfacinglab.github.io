#### Background
Graduated from the Psychology BSc (2018) and the Cognitive Neuroscience MSc (2020) at the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience in Maastricht University. Thereafter he joined the Neural Interfacing Lab as a research assistant. In 2021 he started his PhD studies funded by the Center for Integrative Neuroscience (<a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/centre-integrative-neuroscience-cin">CIN</a>), in a joint collaboration of the Faculty of Health, Medicine, and Life Sciences (FHML), School of Business and Economics (SBE), and Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) at Maastricht University.

#### Research activity
His PhD project aims at investigating the role of memory and the hippocampus in economic decision-making via human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in epileptic patients and ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy adults. This investigation is of importance to both further elucidate the brain workings at play when we make decisions as well as open the way for stimulation approaches for future interventions in the clinical populations. He is also a member of the Ven Memory & Cognition (<a href="https://vincentvandeven.weebly.com/">link</a>) and Perception, Attention, Learning, and Memory (<a href="http://www.deweerdlab.com/
">PALM</a>) research groups.

#### Teaching
In the past years he's been involved in tutoring Statistics I, Statistics II, SPSS, Functional Neuroanatomy, and Economic Psychology (EBC2103) at Maastricht University.
