#### Biography
Maria obtained a bachelor’s degree in Biology and a master’s degree in Neuroscience at University of Lisbon. For her master’s research project she joined the BCI group in Utrecht ((<a href="https://www.nick-ramsey.eu/">Nick Ramsey's Lab</a>) to investigate speech decoding using fMRI at 7T. Now she is a PhD at Maastricht University where she is investigating how the brain processes sounds. Maria’s main interests are cognitive neuroscience (neural encoding and decoding of cognitive phenomena) and neurotechnology (how the intersection between brain and technology can improve the quality of lives of patients).

#### Research Interests
Maria is a PhD student in the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University supervised by Elia Formisano and Christian Herff. She aims to unravel the neural mechanisms that transform acoustic sound representations into meaningful source representations in human auditory cortex using laminar fMRI and stereoEEG.
